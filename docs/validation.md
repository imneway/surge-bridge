# Validation — 2026-10-30

These are observed results for the first development build, not a claim of complete Surge compatibility.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `:app:assembleOtherDebug` | PASS; ARM64, x86_64 and universal APKs generated |
| Converter regression harness | PASS, 35 assertions and native sing-box configuration check |
| Supplied private Work.conf | All four remote rule sets fetched; conversion and native 1.14.4 validation passed; original file unchanged |
| Android import of private Work.conf | PASS via authenticated API; 12 explicit compatibility notices returned |
| Android API/storage/subscription harness | PASS, 30 assertions: auth/Origin/Host, import, source snapshot integrity, selection, invalid-update preservation, remote fetch, TTL rule refresh and HTTP failure preservation |
| Controlled native Snell v6 | PASS, 12 checks: default/unshaped/unsafe-raw × reuse false/true × TCP/UDP |
| Android TUN → Snell v6 → controlled local target | PASS, TCP and UDP; default mode; APK's ARM64 libbox, Android 16 emulator |
| Android VPN permission | First start rejected by API until system dialog approved through UI |
| Service lifecycle API | Observed Stopped → Started, reload accepted while Started, then Stopped |
| Actual supplied server endpoints | All three returned DNS NXDOMAIN using the host system resolver and the config's first encrypted DNS; no Snell handshake occurred |
| Physical Android phone | Deferred by user; not tested |

The real-endpoint failure is different from protocol support: the controlled tests establish working v6 transport, but do not establish reachability of the user's servers. A currently resolvable endpoint (or DNS correction) is needed for that final check; server administrator/version access is not required to continue.

Known differences affecting this supplied config: 7 remote rules containing IP-ASN (including one logical rule), 17 PROCESS-NAME rules and 65 USER-AGENT rules are omitted with warnings. Three redundant per-entry policy fields were normalized. DNS uses the first configured upstream, without Surge's racing/failover. GEOIP database and FINAL,dns-failed behavior differ. See compatibility.md.

Debug events omit raw config/URLs/credentials. The private `.private/` test outputs are intentionally untracked. APK signatures are development signatures; keep the project's debug keystore for in-place future upgrades. Test fixtures use reserved IPs and synthetic PSKs only.
